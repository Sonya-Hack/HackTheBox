# Hack The Box Writeups

<img src="./screenshots/hackthebox_logo.png" alt="Logo"/>

---
Welcome to my personal collection of writeups for machines and challenges on [Hack The Box](https://hackthebox.com/).
Each writeup includes my thought process, tools used, exploitation steps, and post-exploitation notes.

Periodically I will return to the laboratories and machines I have completed and make any changes or improvements to my solutions.

## Structure

Each writeup is organized in its own directory


## ⚠️ Disclaimer
